# Space Shooter Game in C using the SDL Library

This is a project I made for my Introduction to Programming course in Visual Studio. I went with creating an arcade video game as I wanted to work on a fun and challenging project that went beyond the simple command-line interface of the output console. With the SDL library, I was able to import and use sprites, sound files and other assets and have them show up in a separate window running at 60 fps.

Creating and managing object instances was a challenge due to the procedural nature of C. Therefore, I opted to use an array of enemy instances to randomly create enemies at the top of the screen and have them destroyed when they were shot at by the player or when they passed through the bottom of the screen.
